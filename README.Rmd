Ecological and Economic Predictors of MÃ©tiers in a Mixed Fishery, currently in revision in ICES JMS (Authors: Maartje Oostdijk, Elzbieta Baranowska, Sandra Rybicki, Jacob M. Kasper,Sveinn Agnarsson1, Bjarki Elvarsson, Pamela J. Woods)

The analysis relies heavily on MFRI internal and confidential data and researchers interested in obtaining those data are welcomed to contact any of the authors for more information. 

The main folder contains the runall.R file that guides the user through implementing the spatial metier analysis that we employed for the Icelandic demeral fleet. the run_model_tidy.R script is contained in the R folder -> ML_models and runs the random forests (best run via terminal on super computer)

The markdown scripts in the so named folder contain scripts for supplementary figures, a script that collates all the variables for the random forest analysis (gather variables), and a script that plots the outcomes from the ML models (ML_Outputs.Rmd)

the predictor_variables folder in the markdown folder contains some markdown scripts that the authors used to extract data from NC files from Copernicus marine into R data formats.
